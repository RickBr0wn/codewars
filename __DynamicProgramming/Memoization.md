# Reciepe for Memoization

## Make it work with recursion.

- Visualize the problem as a tree.
- Implement the tree using recursion.
- Test the recursion with small use-cases.

## Make it efficient using memoization.

- At the top level add a blank memo object.
- Add a new base-case to return memo values.
- Store return values into the memo object.
